🔆 ABSTRACT

Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are becoming increasingly important for residential energy solutions due to their environmental and economic benefits. This study assesses the technoeconomic viability of a grid connected solar PV system for a single family house in Borrowdale, Harare, Zimbabwe. Using PVsyst simulation software, the proposed system was designed with 16 PV modules, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5.04 kWp. The performance of the system was evaluated based on energy output, efficiency, and financial returns. The simulation predicted an annual energy production of 8003 kWh, with a performance ratio (PR) of 78.51%. Economic analysis revealed a total installation cost of USD 6.770, an annual operating cost of USD 880.76, and a payback period of 2.8 years. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) was calculated at USD 0.16 per kWh. Additionally, the system is expected to reduce CO₂ emissions by 158.5 tons over a 30 year lifetime. These results demonstrate that the system is both technically efficient and economically feasible, offering significant environmental benefits.
